It shows the data structure implementation of working behind the google and other search engines in ordering the searched tab back and forth so to speak.

4 key features
1- Browser(homepage): Set homepage of the browser

2- Visit(url): Visit the url from the current page. It clears up all the forward history.

3- Back(steps): Move ‘steps’ backward in the browser history

4- Forward(steps): Move ‘steps’ forward in the browser history
If you can’t move steps forward or backward, just return the last website that can be reached.
